# Introduction
In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)
 as the AI-powered embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.

# How to run this tutorial

This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) that you can run interactively. You can access the original notebook [here](https://github.com/couchbase-examples/vector-search-cookbook/blob/main/cohere/RAG_with_Couchbase_and_Cohere.ipynb).

You can either download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run it on your system by setting up the Python environment.

# Before you start

## Get Credentials for Cohere

Please follow the [instructions](https://cohere.com/generate) to generate the Cohere credentials.

## Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on Capella

To get started with Couchbase Capella, create an account and use it to deploy a forever free tier operational cluster. This account provides you with a environment where you can explore and learn about Capella with no time constraint.

To know more, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html).

### Couchbase Capella Configuration

When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met.

* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the travel-sample bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.
* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.

# Setting the Stage: Installing Necessary Libraries
To build our semantic search engine, we need a robust set of tools. The libraries we install handle everything from connecting to databases to performing complex machine learning tasks.


```python
!pip install datasets langchain-couchbase langchain-cohere
```

    [Output too long, omitted for brevity]

# Importing Necessary Libraries
The script starts by importing a series of libraries required for various tasks, including handling JSON, logging, time tracking, Couchbase connections, embedding generation, and dataset loading. These libraries provide essential functions for working with data, managing database connections, and processing machine learning models.


```python
import json
import logging
import os
import time
import sys
import getpass
from datetime import timedelta
from uuid import uuid4

from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.exceptions import (CouchbaseException,
                                  InternalServerFailureException,
                                  QueryIndexAlreadyExistsException)
from couchbase.management.search import SearchIndex
from couchbase.options import ClusterOptions
from datasets import load_dataset
from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere, CohereEmbeddings
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_couchbase.cache import CouchbaseCache
from langchain_couchbase.vectorstores import CouchbaseVectorStore
from tqdm import tqdm
```

    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pydantic/_internal/_config.py:341: UserWarning: Valid config keys have changed in V2:
    * 'allow_population_by_field_name' has been renamed to 'populate_by_name'
    * 'smart_union' has been removed
      warnings.warn(message, UserWarning)


# Setup Logging
Logging is configured to track the progress of the script and capture any errors or warnings. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the flow of execution. The logging output includes timestamps, log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR), and messages that describe what is happening in the script.



```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',force=True)
```

# Loading Sensitive Informnation
In this section, we prompt the user to input essential configuration settings needed for integrating Couchbase with Cohere's API. These settings include sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and specific configuration names. Instead of hardcoding these details into the script, we request the user to provide them at runtime, ensuring flexibility and security.

The script also validates that all required inputs are provided, raising an error if any crucial information is missing. This approach ensures that your integration is both secure and correctly configured without hardcoding sensitive information, enhancing the overall security and maintainability of your code.


```python
COHERE_API_KEY = getpass.getpass('Enter your Cohere API key: ')
CB_HOST = input('Enter your Couchbase host (default: couchbase://localhost): ') or 'couchbase://localhost'
CB_USERNAME = input('Enter your Couchbase username (default: Administrator): ') or 'Administrator'
CB_PASSWORD = getpass.getpass('Enter your Couchbase password (default: password): ') or 'password'
CB_BUCKET_NAME = input('Enter your Couchbase bucket name (default: vector-search-testing): ') or 'vector-search-testing'
INDEX_NAME = input('Enter your index name (default: vector_search_cohere): ') or 'vector_search_cohere'
SCOPE_NAME = input('Enter your scope name (default: shared): ') or 'shared'
COLLECTION_NAME = input('Enter your collection name (default: cohere): ') or 'cohere'
CACHE_COLLECTION = input('Enter your cache collection name (default: cache): ') or 'cache'

# Check if the variables are correctly loaded
if not COHERE_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("COHERE_API_KEY is not provided and is required.")
```

    Enter your Cohere API key: ··········
    Enter your Couchbase host (default: couchbase://localhost): couchbases://cb.hlcup4o4jmjr55yf.cloud.couchbase.com
    Enter your Couchbase username (default: Administrator): vector-search-rag-demos
    Enter your Couchbase password (default: password): ··········
    Enter your Couchbase bucket name (default: vector-search-testing): 
    Enter your index name (default: vector_search_cohere): 
    Enter your scope name (default: shared): 
    Enter your collection name (default: cohere): 
    Enter your cache collection name (default: cache): 


# Connect to Couchbase
The script attempts to establish a connection to the Couchbase database using the credentials retrieved from the environment variables. Couchbase is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and support for various data models, including document-based storage. The connection is authenticated using a username and password, and the script waits until the connection is fully established before proceeding.





```python
try:
    auth = PasswordAuthenticator(CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD)
    options = ClusterOptions(auth)
    cluster = Cluster(CB_HOST, options)
    cluster.wait_until_ready(timedelta(seconds=5))
    logging.info("Successfully connected to Couchbase")
except Exception as e:
    raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to Couchbase: {str(e)}")
```

    2024-08-29 12:37:48,036 - INFO - Successfully connected to Couchbase


# Setting Up Collections in Couchbase
In Couchbase, data is organized in buckets, which can be further divided into scopes and collections. Think of a collection as a table in a traditional SQL database. Before we can store any data, we need to ensure that our collections exist. If they don't, we must create them. This step is important because it prepares the database to handle the specific types of data our application will process. By setting up collections, we define the structure of our data storage, which is essential for efficient data retrieval and management.

Moreover, setting up collections allows us to isolate different types of data within the same bucket, providing a more organized and scalable data structure. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it ensures that related data is stored together, making it easier to manage and query.



```python
def setup_collection(cluster, bucket_name, scope_name, collection_name):
    try:
        bucket = cluster.bucket(bucket_name)
        bucket_manager = bucket.collections()

        # Check if collection exists, create if it doesn't
        collections = bucket_manager.get_all_scopes()
        collection_exists = any(
            scope.name == scope_name and collection_name in [col.name for col in scope.collections]
            for scope in collections
        )

        if not collection_exists:
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' does not exist. Creating it...")
            bucket_manager.create_collection(scope_name, collection_name)
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' created successfully.")
        else:
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' already exists.Skipping creation.")

        collection = bucket.scope(scope_name).collection(collection_name)

        # Ensure primary index exists
        try:
            cluster.query(f"CREATE PRIMARY INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ON `{bucket_name}`.`{scope_name}`.`{collection_name}`").execute()
            logging.info("Primary index present or created successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error creating primary index: {str(e)}")

        # Clear all documents in the collection
        try:
            query = f"DELETE FROM `{bucket_name}`.`{scope_name}`.`{collection_name}`"
            cluster.query(query).execute()
            logging.info("All documents cleared from the collection.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error while clearing documents: {str(e)}. The collection might be empty.")

        return collection
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error setting up collection: {str(e)}")

setup_collection(cluster, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME)
setup_collection(cluster, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, CACHE_COLLECTION)

# Loading Couchbase Vector Search Index

Semantic search requires an efficient way to retrieve relevant documents based on a user's query. This is where the Couchbase **Vector Search Index** comes into play. In this step, we load the Vector Search Index definition from a JSON file, which specifies how the index should be structured. This includes the fields to be indexed, the dimensions of the vectors, and other parameters that determine how the search engine processes queries based on vector similarity.

For more information on creating a vector search index, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-search/create-vector-search-index-ui.html).



```python
# If you are running this script locally (not in Google Colab), uncomment the following line
# and provide the path to your index definition file.

# index_definition_path = '/path_to_your_index_file/cohere_index.json'  # Local setup: specify your file path here

# If you are running in Google Colab, use the following code to upload the index definition file
from google.colab import files
print("Upload your index definition file")
uploaded = files.upload()
index_definition_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]

try:
    with open(index_definition_path, 'r') as file:
        index_definition = json.load(file)
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error loading index definition from {index_definition_path}: {str(e)}")
```

    Upload your index definition file


    Saving cohere_index.json to cohere_index.json


# Creating or Updating Search Indexes

With the index definition loaded, the next step is to create or update the **Vector Search Index** in Couchbase. This step is crucial because it optimizes our database for vector similarity search operations, allowing us to perform searches based on the semantic content of documents rather than just keywords. By creating or updating a Vector Search Index, we enable our search engine to handle complex queries that involve finding semantically similar documents using vector embeddings, which is essential for a robust semantic search engine.


```python
try:
    scope_index_manager = cluster.bucket(CB_BUCKET_NAME).scope(SCOPE_NAME).search_indexes()

    # Check if index already exists
    existing_indexes = scope_index_manager.get_all_indexes()
    index_name = index_definition["name"]

    if index_name in [index.name for index in existing_indexes]:
        logging.info(f"Index '{index_name}' found")
    else:
        logging.info(f"Creating new index '{index_name}'...")

    # Create SearchIndex object from JSON definition
    search_index = SearchIndex.from_json(index_definition)

    # Upsert the index (create if not exists, update if exists)
    scope_index_manager.upsert_index(search_index)
    logging.info(f"Index '{index_name}' successfully created/updated.")

except QueryIndexAlreadyExistsException:
    logging.info(f"Index '{index_name}' already exists. Skipping creation/update.")

except InternalServerFailureException as e:
    error_message = str(e)
    logging.error(f"InternalServerFailureException raised: {error_message}")

    try:
        # Accessing the response_body attribute from the context
        error_context = e.context
        response_body = error_context.response_body
        if response_body:
            error_details = json.loads(response_body)
            error_message = error_details.get('error', '')

            if "collection: 'cohere' doesn't belong to scope: 'shared'" in error_message:
                raise ValueError("Collection 'cohere' does not belong to scope 'shared'. Please check the collection and scope names.")

    except ValueError as ve:
        logging.error(str(ve))
        raise

    except Exception as json_error:
        logging.error(f"Failed to parse the error message: {json_error}")
        raise RuntimeError(f"Internal server error while creating/updating search index: {error_message}")
```

# Load TREC Dataset
The TREC dataset is loaded using the datasets library. TREC is a well-known dataset used in information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this script, the dataset will be used to generate embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture its meaning in a form suitable for machine learning models.



```python
try:
    trec = load_dataset('trec', split='train[:1000]')
    logging.info(f"Successfully loaded TREC dataset with {len(trec)} samples")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error loading TREC dataset: {str(e)}")
```

# Create Embeddings
Embeddings are created using the Cohere API. Embeddings are vectors (arrays of numbers) that represent the meaning of text in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings are crucial for tasks like semantic search, where the goal is to find text that is semantically similar to a query. The script uses a pre-trained model provided by Cohere to generate embeddings for the text in the TREC dataset.


```python
try:
    embeddings = CohereEmbeddings(
        cohere_api_key=COHERE_API_KEY,
        model="embed-english-v3.0",
    )
    logging.info("Successfully created CohereEmbeddings")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating CohereEmbeddings: {str(e)}")
```

    2024-08-29 12:38:05,146 - INFO - Successfully created CohereEmbeddings


# Set Up Vector Store
The vector store is set up to manage the embeddings created in the previous step. The vector store is essentially a database optimized for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors. In this case, the vector store is built on top of Couchbase, allowing the script to store the embeddings in a way that can be efficiently searched.



```python
try:
    vector_store = CouchbaseVectorStore(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        embedding=embeddings,
        index_name=INDEX_NAME,
    )
    logging.info("Successfully created vector store")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create vector store: {str(e)}")
```

    2024-08-29 12:38:05,749 - INFO - Successfully created vector store


# Save Data to Vector Store in Batches
To avoid overloading memory, the TREC dataset's text fields are saved to the vector store in batches. This step is important for handling large datasets, as it breaks down the data into manageable chunks that can be processed sequentially. Each piece of text is converted into a document, assigned a unique identifier, and then stored in the vector store.



```python
try:
    batch_size = 50
    logging.disable(sys.maxsize) # Disable logging to prevent tqdm output
    for i in tqdm(range(0, len(trec['text']), batch_size), desc="Processing Batches"):
        batch = trec['text'][i:i + batch_size]
        documents = [Document(page_content=text) for text in batch]
        uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
        vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)
    logging.disable(logging.NOTSET) # Re-enable logging
except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to save documents to vector store: {str(e)}")
```

    Processing Batches: 100%|██████████| 20/20 [00:22<00:00,  1.13s/it]


# Set Up Cache
 A cache is set up using Couchbase to store intermediate results and frequently accessed data. Caching is important for improving performance, as it reduces the need to repeatedly calculate or retrieve the same data. The cache is linked to a specific collection in Couchbase, and it is used later in the script to store the results of language model queries.



```python
try:
    cache = CouchbaseCache(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
        collection_name=CACHE_COLLECTION,
    )
    logging.info("Successfully created cache")
    set_llm_cache(cache)
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create cache: {str(e)}")
```

    2024-08-29 12:38:28,910 - INFO - Successfully created cache


# Create Language Model (LLM)
The script initializes a Cohere language model (LLM) that will be used for generating responses to queries. LLMs are powerful tools for natural language understanding and generation, capable of producing human-like text based on input prompts. The model is configured with specific parameters, such as the temperature, which controls the randomness of its outputs.



```python
try:
    llm = ChatCohere(
        cohere_api_key=COHERE_API_KEY,
        model="command",
        temperature=0
    )
    logging.info(f"Successfully created Cohere LLM with model command")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating Cohere LLM: {str(e)}")
```

    2024-08-29 12:38:29,015 - INFO - Successfully created Cohere LLM with model command


# Perform Semantic Search
Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.

In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison.


```python
query = "Why do heavier objects travel downhill faster?"

try:
    # Perform the semantic search
    start_time = time.time()
    search_results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=10)
    search_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    logging.info(f"Semantic search completed in {search_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")

    # Display search results
    print(f"\nSemantic Search Results (completed in {search_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds):")
    for doc, score in search_results:
        print(f"Distance: {score:.4f}, Text: {doc.page_content}")

except CouchbaseException as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Error performing semantic search: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and Langchain
Couchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.

The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation.


```python
try:
    template = """You are a helpful bot. If you cannot answer based on the context provided, respond with a generic answer. Answer the question as truthfully as possible using the context below:
    {context}

    Question: {question}"""

    RAG Response: Heavier objects travel downhill faster due to gravitational forces. As an object moves downhill, gravity accelerates the object, and velocity increases. The force of gravity is proportional to the object's mass, meaning heavier objects experience a more substantial gravitational force, leading to faster downhill speeds.
    
    This relationship, known as the gravitational force equation, explains why heavier objects descend faster than lighter ones- 
    
    ```
    force of gravity = gravitational force = acceleration due to gravity * mass = F = m*g
    ```
    
    In this equation, the acceleration due to gravity is a constant value represented by `g`, and the mass `m` represents the object's mass. Consequently, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the object's mass, explaining heavier objects's downhill speed.
    
    As a generic response, this explains the fundamental principle of gravity's impact on downhill speed, however, on a broader context, this answer refers to objects moving along a gravitational field, such as a hill.

# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism
Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.

For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.


```python
try:
    queries = [
        "How does photosynthesis work?",
        "What is the capital of France?",
        "Why do heavier objects travel downhill faster?",  # Repeated query
        "How does photosynthesis work?",  # Repeated query
    ]

    for i, query in enumerate(queries, 1):
        print(f"\nQuery {i}: {query}")
        start_time = time.time()
        response = rag_chain.invoke(query)
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"Response: {response}")
        print(f"Time taken: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error generating RAG response: {str(e)}")

    Query 1: How does photosynthesis work?
    Response: Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, specifically glucose. The process occurs in special structures called chloroplasts within the plant's cells. Here are the steps behind photosynthesis:
    
    1. Absorption of sunlight: Chlorophyll, a pigment found in chloroplasts, captures the energy of sunlight.
    
    2. Light reaction: The absorbed sunlight energizes electrons within the chloroplasts, initiating a series of complex reactions. During this stage, water molecules are split into hydrogen ions (H+), electrons (e^-), and oxygen atoms (O). The oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct, while the hydrogen ions and electrons are utilized in the next stage.
    
    3. Carbon fixation: The energized hydrogen ions and electrons combine with carbon dioxide (CO2) in a process known as the Calvin cycle. Through a series of enzyme-mediated reactions, this combination produces glucose and other organic molecules that serve as the primary energy source and building blocks for the plant's growth and development. 
    
    Overall, the essence of photosynthesis is the transformation of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into chemical energy (glucose) and oxygen. This process is essential for plant life and also serves as the primary energy source for almost all life on Earth, as plants are the primary producers in many ecosystems, forming the base of the food chain.
