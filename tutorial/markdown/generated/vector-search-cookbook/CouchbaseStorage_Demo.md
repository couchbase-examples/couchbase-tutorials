# CrewAI with Couchbase Short-Term Memory

This notebook demonstrates how to implement a custom storage backend for CrewAI's memory system using Couchbase and vector search. Here's a breakdown of each section:

How to run this tutorial
----------------------
This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run 
interactively. You can access the original notebook here.

You can either:
- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment

Before you start
---------------

1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)
   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy 
     a forever free tier operational cluster
   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn 
     about Capella with no time constraint
   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)

2. Couchbase Capella Configuration
   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:
   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) 
     used in the application
   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)

# Memory in AI Agents

Memory in AI agents is a crucial capability that allows them to retain and utilize information across interactions, making them more effective and contextually aware. Without memory, agents would be limited to processing only the immediate input, lacking the ability to build upon past experiences or maintain continuity in conversations.

> Note: This section on memory types and functionality is adapted from the CrewAI documentation.

## Types of Memory in AI Agents

### Short-term Memory
- Retains recent interactions and context
- Typically spans the current conversation or session  
- Helps maintain coherence within a single interaction flow
- In CrewAI, this is what we're implementing with the Couchbase storage

### Long-term Memory
- Stores persistent knowledge across multiple sessions
- Enables agents to recall past interactions even after long periods
- Helps build cumulative knowledge about users, preferences, and past decisions
- While this implementation is labeled as "short-term memory", the Couchbase storage backend can be effectively used for long-term memory as well, thanks to Couchbase's persistent storage capabilities and enterprise-grade durability features



## How Memory Works in Agents
Memory in AI agents typically involves:
- Storage: Information is encoded and stored in a database (like Couchbase, ChromaDB, or other vector stores)
- Retrieval: Relevant memories are fetched based on semantic similarity to current context
- Integration: Retrieved memories are incorporated into the agent's reasoning process

In the CrewAI example, the CouchbaseStorage class implements:
- save(): Stores new memories with metadata
- search(): Retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity
- reset(): Clears stored memories when needed

## Benefits of Memory in AI Agents
- Contextual Understanding: Agents can refer to previous parts of a conversation
- Personalization: Remembering user preferences and past interactions
- Learning and Adaptation: Building knowledge over time to improve responses
- Task Continuity: Resuming complex tasks across multiple interactions
- Collaboration: In multi-agent systems like CrewAI, memory enables agents to build on each other's work

## Memory in CrewAI Specifically
In CrewAI, memory serves several important functions:
- Agent Specialization: Each agent can maintain its own memory relevant to its expertise
- Knowledge Transfer: Agents can share insights through memory when collaborating on tasks
- Process Continuity: In sequential processes, later agents can access the work of earlier agents
- Contextual Awareness: Agents can reference previous findings when making decisions

The vector-based approach (using embeddings) is particularly powerful because it allows for semantic search - finding memories that are conceptually related to the current context, not just exact keyword matches.

By implementing custom storage like Couchbase, you gain additional benefits like persistence, scalability, and the ability to leverage enterprise-grade database features for your agent memory systems.

## Install Required Libraries

This section installs the necessary Python packages:
- `crewai`: The main CrewAI framework
- `langchain-couchbase`: LangChain integration for Couchbase
- `langchain-openai`: LangChain integration for OpenAI
- `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables


```python
%pip install --quiet crewai langchain-couchbase langchain-openai python-dotenv
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.


## Importing Necessary Libraries

The script starts by importing a series of libraries required for various tasks, including handling JSON, logging, time tracking, Couchbase connections, embedding generation, and dataset loading.


```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
import os
import logging
from datetime import timedelta
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage
from crewai.memory.short_term.short_term_memory import ShortTermMemory
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.options import ClusterOptions
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.diagnostics import PingState, ServiceType
from langchain_couchbase.vectorstores import CouchbaseVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
import time
import json
import uuid

# Configure logging (disabled)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Loading Sensitive Information

In this section, we prompt the user to input essential configuration settings needed. These settings include sensitive information like database credentials, and specific configuration names. Instead of hardcoding these details into the script, we request the user to provide them at runtime, ensuring flexibility and security.

The script uses environment variables to store sensitive information, enhancing the overall security and maintainability of your code by avoiding hardcoded values.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

> **Note:** This implementation reads configuration parameters from environment variables. Before running this notebook, you need to set the following environment variables:
>
> - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for generating embeddings
> - `CB_HOST`: Couchbase cluster connection string (e.g., "couchbases://cb.example.com")
> - `CB_USERNAME`: Username for Couchbase authentication
> - `CB_PASSWORD`: Password for Couchbase authentication
> - `CB_BUCKET_NAME` (optional): Bucket name (defaults to "vector-search-testing")
> - `SCOPE_NAME` (optional): Scope name (defaults to "shared")
> - `COLLECTION_NAME` (optional): Collection name (defaults to "crew")
> - `INDEX_NAME` (optional): Vector search index name (defaults to "vector_search_crew")
>
> You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as this notebook, or set them directly in your environment.


```python
load_dotenv()

# Verify environment variables
required_vars = ['OPENAI_API_KEY', 'CB_HOST', 'CB_USERNAME', 'CB_PASSWORD']
for var in required_vars:
    if not os.getenv(var):
        raise ValueError(f"{var} environment variable is required")
```

## Implement CouchbaseStorage

This section demonstrates the implementation of a custom vector storage solution using Couchbase:

> **Note on Implementation:** This example uses the LangChain Couchbase integration (`langchain_couchbase`) for simplicity and to demonstrate integration with the broader LangChain ecosystem. In production environments, you may want to use the Couchbase SDK directly for better performance and more control.

> For more information on using the Couchbase SDK directly, refer to:
> - [Couchbase Python SDK Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/full-text-searching-with-sdk.html#single-vector-query)

## Test Basic Storage

Test storing and retrieving a simple memory:


```python
# Initialize storage
storage = CouchbaseStorage(
    type="short_term",
    embedder_config={
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {"model": "text-embedding-3-small"}
    }
)

# Reset storage
storage.reset()

# Test storage
test_memory = "Pep Guardiola praised Manchester City's current form, saying 'The team is playing well, we are in a good moment. The way we are training, the way we are playing - I am really pleased.'"
test_metadata = {"category": "sports", "test": "initial_memory"}
storage.save(test_memory, test_metadata)

# Test search
results = storage.search("What did Guardiola say about Manchester City?", limit=1)
for result in results:
    print(f"Found: {result['context']}\nScore: {result['score']}\nMetadata: {result['metadata']}")
```

    Found: Pep Guardiola praised Manchester City's current form, saying 'The team is playing well, we are in a good moment. The way we are training, the way we are playing - I am really pleased.'
    Score: 0.6598483920097351
    Metadata: {}


## Test CrewAI Integration

Create agents and tasks to test memory retention:


```python
# Initialize ShortTermMemory with our storage
memory = ShortTermMemory(storage=storage)

# Initialize language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Create agents with memory
sports_analyst = Agent(
    role='Sports Analyst',
    goal='Analyze Manchester City performance',
    backstory='Expert at analyzing football teams and providing insights on their performance',
    llm=llm,
    memory=True,
    memory_storage=memory
)

journalist = Agent(
    role='Sports Journalist',
    goal='Create engaging football articles',
    backstory='Experienced sports journalist who specializes in Premier League coverage',
    llm=llm,
    memory=True,
    memory_storage=memory
)

# Create tasks
analysis_task = Task(
    description='Analyze Manchester City\'s recent performance based on Pep Guardiola\'s comments: "The team is playing well, we are in a good moment. The way we are training, the way we are playing - I am really pleased."',
    agent=sports_analyst,
    expected_output="A comprehensive analysis of Manchester City's current form based on Guardiola's comments."
)

writing_task = Task(
    description='Write a sports article about Manchester City\'s form using the analysis and Guardiola\'s comments.',
    agent=journalist,
    context=[analysis_task],
    expected_output="An engaging sports article about Manchester City's current form and Guardiola's perspective."
)

# Create crew with memory
crew = Crew(
    agents=[sports_analyst, journalist],
    tasks=[analysis_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    short_term_memory=memory,  # Explicitly pass our memory implementation
    verbose=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()

print("\nCrew Result:")
print("-" * 80)
print(result)
print("-" * 80)
```

    # Agent: Sports Analyst
    ## Task: Analyze Manchester City's recent performance based on Pep Guardiola's comments: "The team is playing well, we are in a good moment. The way we are training, the way we are playing - I am really pleased."
    
    
    # Agent: Sports Analyst
    ## Final Answer: 
    Analyzing Manchester City's recent performance based on Pep Guardiola's comments, it is clear that the team is operating at a high level. Guardiola's statement, "The team is playing well, we are in a good moment. The way we are training, the way we are playing - I am really pleased," gives insight into both the current form and the overall environment within the squad.
    
    Historically, Manchester City under Guardiola has been known for their possession-based style, high pressing, and tactical flexibility. Comparing their current form to past performances, City appears to be continuing their trend of dominance, especially in terms of controlling matches and creating goal-scoring opportunities. Recent match statistics highlight their effectiveness; for example, in their last few games, City has consistently maintained possession percentages above 60%, showcasing their ability to control the tempo of the game.
    
    Key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland, and Phil Foden have been pivotal in their recent successes. De Bruyne's vision and passing ability have been instrumental in breaking down defenses, while Haaland's goal-scoring prowess has added a new dimension to City's attacking threat. Foden's versatility and creativity have also been crucial, providing Guardiola with multiple tactical options.
    
    Despite the positive comments from Guardiola, there are still areas where City can improve. Defensive lapses have occasionally been a concern, as seen in matches where they conceded goals due to individual errors or lapses in concentration. Addressing these issues will be critical for maintaining their form throughout the season.
    
    Guardiola's satisfaction with the team's training and performance indicates a harmonious and focused squad, which is essential for sustained success. His comments also reflect the strategic innovations he has implemented, such as adapting formations and player roles to maximize the team's strengths and exploit opponents' weaknesses.
    
    In conclusion, Manchester City's current form is a testament to Guardiola's tactical expertise and the players' execution on the pitch. While there are minor areas for improvement, the overall outlook is positive, and they are well-positioned to compete for titles this season. The combination of Guardiola's strategic leadership and the team's depth and quality suggests that City will continue to be a formidable force in football.

Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining their momentum and ensuring that they remain competitive across all fronts.
    
    Guardiola’s comments reflect not only a satisfied manager but also a strategic thinker constantly innovating to maximize the team’s strengths. His ability to adapt formations and player roles is a hallmark of his managerial prowess, ensuring that City not only plays to their strengths but also exploits the weaknesses of their opponents.
    
    Looking ahead, Manchester City faces a challenging fixture schedule, with both domestic and European competitions testing their resolve. However, with Guardiola at the helm and the squad’s depth and quality, they are well-positioned to surmount these challenges. The combination of strategic leadership and player execution suggests that City will continue to be a formidable force in football.
    
    In conclusion, Manchester City’s current form is a masterclass in footballing excellence, driven by Guardiola’s tactical expertise and the players’ execution on the pitch. While there are minor areas for improvement, the overall outlook is positive, and they are poised to compete for titles this season.
