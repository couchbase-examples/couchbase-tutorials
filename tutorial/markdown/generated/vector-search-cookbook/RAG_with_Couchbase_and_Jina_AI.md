# Semantic Search with Couchbase GSI Vector Indexes and Jina AI

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates building a high-performance semantic search engine using Couchbase's GSI (Global Secondary Index) vector search and Jina AI for embeddings and language models. We'll show measurable performance improvements with GSI optimization and implement a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

**Key Features:**
- High-performance GSI vector search with BHIVE indexing
- Jina AI embeddings and language models
- Performance benchmarks showing GSI benefits
- Complete RAG workflow with caching optimization

**Requirements:** Couchbase Server 8.0+ or Capella with Query Service enabled.

    raise ValueError("JINACHAT_API_KEY environment variable is not set")
```

## Couchbase Connection Setup

### Connect to Cluster

Establish connection to Couchbase cluster for vector storage and retrieval operations.


```python
try:
    auth = PasswordAuthenticator(CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD)
    options = ClusterOptions(auth)
    cluster = Cluster(CB_HOST, options)
    cluster.wait_until_ready(timedelta(seconds=5))
    logging.info("Successfully connected to Couchbase")
except Exception as e:
    raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to Couchbase: {str(e)}")
```

    2025-10-08 11:18:34,736 - INFO - Successfully connected to Couchbase


### Setup Collections

The setup_collection() function handles creating and configuring the hierarchical data organization in Couchbase:

1. Bucket Creation:
   - Checks if specified bucket exists, creates it if not
   - Sets bucket properties like RAM quota (1024MB) and replication (disabled)
   - Note: You will not be able to create a bucket on Capella

2. Scope Management:  
   - Verifies if requested scope exists within bucket
   - Creates new scope if needed (unless it's the default "_default" scope)

3. Collection Setup:
   - Checks for collection existence within scope
   - Creates collection if it doesn't exist
   - Waits 2 seconds for collection to be ready

Additional Tasks:
- Clears any existing documents for clean state

The function is called twice to set up:
1. Main collection for vector embeddings
2. Cache collection for storing results



```python
def setup_collection(cluster, bucket_name, scope_name, collection_name):
    try:
        # Check if bucket exists, create if it doesn't
        try:
            bucket = cluster.bucket(bucket_name)
            logging.info(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' exists.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.info(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' does not exist. Creating it...")
            bucket_settings = CreateBucketSettings(
                name=bucket_name,
                bucket_type='couchbase',
                ram_quota_mb=1024,
                flush_enabled=True,
                num_replicas=0
            )
            cluster.buckets().create_bucket(bucket_settings)
            time.sleep(2)  # Wait for bucket creation to complete and become available
            bucket = cluster.bucket(bucket_name)
            logging.info(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' created successfully.")

        bucket_manager = bucket.collections()

        # Check if scope exists, create if it doesn't
        scopes = bucket_manager.get_all_scopes()
        scope_exists = any(scope.name == scope_name for scope in scopes)
        
        if not scope_exists and scope_name != "_default":
            logging.info(f"Scope '{scope_name}' does not exist. Creating it...")
            bucket_manager.create_scope(scope_name)
            logging.info(f"Scope '{scope_name}' created successfully.")

        # Check if collection exists, create if it doesn't
        collections = bucket_manager.get_all_scopes()
        collection_exists = any(
            scope.name == scope_name and collection_name in [col.name for col in scope.collections]
            for scope in collections
        )

        if not collection_exists:
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' does not exist. Creating it...")
            bucket_manager.create_collection(scope_name, collection_name)
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' created successfully.")
        else:
            logging.info(f"Collection '{collection_name}' already exists. Skipping creation.")

        # Wait for collection to be ready
        collection = bucket.scope(scope_name).collection(collection_name)
        time.sleep(2)  # Give the collection time to be ready for queries

        # Clear all documents in the collection
        try:
            query = f"DELETE FROM `{bucket_name}`.`{scope_name}`.`{collection_name}`"
            cluster.query(query).execute()
            logging.info("All documents cleared from the collection.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error while clearing documents: {str(e)}. The collection might be empty.")

        return collection
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error setting up collection: {str(e)}")
    
setup_collection(cluster, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME)
setup_collection(cluster, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, CACHE_COLLECTION)
```

## Document Processing and Vector Store

### Create Jina Embeddings

Set up Jina AI embeddings to convert text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning for similarity search.


```python
try:
    embeddings = JinaEmbeddings(
        jina_api_key=JINA_API_KEY, model_name="jina-embeddings-v3"
    )
    logging.info("Successfully created JinaEmbeddings")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating JinaEmbeddings: {str(e)}")
```

    2025-10-08 11:18:56,191 - INFO - Successfully created JinaEmbeddings


### Create GSI Vector Store

Set up the GSI vector store for high-performance vector storage and similarity search using Couchbase's Query Service.


```python
try:
    vector_store = CouchbaseQueryVectorStore(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        embedding=embeddings,
        distance_metric=DistanceStrategy.COSINE
    )
    logging.info("Successfully created GSI vector store")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create GSI vector store: {str(e)}")
```

    2025-10-08 11:18:57,341 - INFO - Successfully created GSI vector store


### Index Creation Timing

**Important**: GSI Vector Indexes must be created AFTER uploading vector data. The index creation process analyzes existing vectors to optimize search performance through clustering and quantization.

### Load Dataset

Load the BBC News dataset for real-world testing data with authentic news articles covering various topics.


```python
try:
    news_dataset = load_dataset(
        "RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime", "2024-12", split="train"
    )
    print(f"Loaded the BBC News dataset with {len(news_dataset)} rows")
    logging.info(f"Successfully loaded the BBC News dataset with {len(news_dataset)} rows.")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error loading the BBC News dataset: {str(e)}")
```

    2025-10-08 11:19:03,903 - INFO - Successfully loaded the BBC News dataset with 2687 rows.


    Loaded the BBC News dataset with 2687 rows


#### Clean Data

Remove duplicate articles to ensure clean search results.


```python
news_articles = news_dataset["content"]
unique_articles = set()
for article in news_articles:
    if article:
        unique_articles.add(article)
unique_news_articles = list(unique_articles)
print(f"We have {len(unique_news_articles)} unique articles in our database.")
```

    We have 1749 unique articles in our database.


#### Store Data

Process articles in batches and store them in the vector database with embeddings. We'll use 60% of the dataset for faster processing while maintaining good search quality.


```python
# Calculate 60% of the dataset size and round to nearest integer
dataset_size = len(unique_news_articles)
subset_size = round(dataset_size * 0.6)

# Filter articles by length and create subset
filtered_articles = [article for article in unique_news_articles[:subset_size] 
                    if article and len(article) <= 50000]

# Process in batches
batch_size = 50

try:
    vector_store.add_texts(
        texts=filtered_articles,
        batch_size=batch_size
    )
    logging.info("Document ingestion completed successfully")
    
except CouchbaseException as e:
    logging.error(f"Couchbase error during ingestion: {str(e)}")
    raise RuntimeError(f"Error performing document ingestion: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    if "Payment Required" in str(e):
        logging.error("Payment required for Jina AI API. Please check your subscription status and API key.")
        print("To resolve this error:")
        print("1. Visit 'https://jina.ai/reader/#pricing' to review subscription options")
        print("2. Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits") 
        print("3. Consider upgrading your subscription plan if needed")
    else:
        logging.error(f"Unexpected error during ingestion: {str(e)}")
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to save documents to vector store: {str(e)}")
```

    2025-10-08 11:20:18,363 - INFO - Document ingestion completed successfully


## Vector Search Performance Testing

Now let's demonstrate the performance benefits of GSI optimization by testing pure vector search performance. We'll compare three optimization levels:

1. **Baseline Performance**: Vector search without GSI optimization
2. **GSI-Optimized Performance**: Same search with BHIVE GSI index
3. **Cache Benefits**: Show how caching can be applied on top of GSI for repeated queries

### GSI Vector Index Types Overview

Before we start testing, let's understand the index types available:

**Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE):**
- **Best for**: Pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search
- **Performance**: High performance with low memory footprint, designed to scale to billions of vectors
- **Optimization**: Optimized for concurrent operations, supports simultaneous searches and inserts
- **Use when**: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering
- **Ideal for**: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery

**Composite Vector Indexes:**
- **Best for**: Filtered vector searches that combine vector search with scalar value filtering
- **Performance**: Efficient pre-filtering where scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope
- **Use when**: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data
- **Ideal for**: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries
- **Note**: Scalar filters take precedence over vector similarity

**Choosing the Right Index Type:**
- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets
- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space
- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions

For this tutorial, we'll use **BHIVE** as it's optimized for pure semantic search scenarios.

### Index Configuration Details

The `index_description` parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage and search performance through centroids and quantization:

**Format**: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`

#### **IVF (Inverted File Index) - Centroids Configuration**
- **Purpose**: Controls how the dataset is subdivided into clusters for faster searches
- **Trade-offs**: More centroids = faster searches but slower training time
- **Auto-selection**: If omitted (e.g., `IVF,SQ8`), Couchbase automatically selects the optimal number based on dataset size
- **Manual setting**: Specify exact count (e.g., `IVF1000,SQ8` for 1000 centroids)

#### **Quantization Options - Vector Compression**

**SQ (Scalar Quantization)**
- **Purpose**: Compresses vectors by reducing precision of individual components
- **Settings**: `SQ4`, `SQ6`, `SQ8` (4-bit, 6-bit, 8-bit precision)
- **Trade-off**: Lower bits = more compression but less precision
- **Best for**: General-purpose applications where some precision loss is acceptable

**PQ (Product Quantization)**
- **Purpose**: Advanced compression using subquantizers for better precision
- **Format**: `PQ<subquantizers>x<bits>` (e.g., `PQ32x8` = 32 subquantizers of 8 bits each)
- **Trade-off**: More complex but often better precision than SQ at similar compression ratios
- **Best for**: Applications requiring high precision with significant compression

#### **Common Configuration Examples**

```
IVF,SQ8          # Auto-selected centroids with 8-bit scalar quantization (recommended default)
IVF1000,SQ6      # 1000 centroids with 6-bit scalar quantization (higher compression)
IVF,PQ32x8       # Auto-selected centroids with 32 subquantizers of 8 bits each
IVF500,PQ16x4    # 500 centroids with 16 subquantizers of 4 bits each (high compression)
```

#### **Performance Considerations**

**Distance Interpretation**: In GSI vector search, lower distance values indicate higher similarity, while higher distance values indicate lower similarity.

**Scalability**: BHIVE indexes can scale to billions of vectors with optimized concurrent operations, making them suitable for large-scale production deployments.

For detailed configuration options, see the [Quantization & Centroid Settings](https://preview.docs-test.couchbase.com/docs-server-DOC-12565_vector_search_concepts/server/current/vector-index/hyperscale-vector-index.html#algo_settings).

For more information on GSI Vector Indexes, see [Couchbase GSI Vector Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/vector-search.html).

### Vector Search Test Function


```python
def test_vector_search_performance(vector_store, query, label="Vector Search"):
    """Test pure vector search performance and return timing metrics"""
    print(f"\n[{label}] Testing vector search performance")
    print(f"[{label}] Query: '{query}'")
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    try:
        results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3)
        end_time = time.time()
        search_time = end_time - start_time
        
        print(f"[{label}] Vector search completed in {search_time:.4f} seconds")
        print(f"[{label}] Found {len(results)} documents")
        
        if results:
            doc, distance = results[0]
            print(f"[{label}] Top result distance: {distance:.6f} (lower = more similar)")
            preview = doc.page_content[:100] + "..." if len(doc.page_content) > 100 else doc.page_content
            print(f"[{label}] Top result preview: {preview}")
        
        return search_time
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[{label}] Vector search failed: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

### Test 1: Baseline Performance (No GSI Index)

Test pure vector search performance without GSI optimization.


```python
# Test baseline vector search performance without GSI index
test_query = "What was manchester city manager pep guardiola's reaction to the team's current form?"
print("Testing baseline vector search performance without GSI optimization...")
baseline_time = test_vector_search_performance(vector_store, test_query, "Baseline Search")
print(f"\nBaseline vector search time (without GSI): {baseline_time:.4f} seconds\n")
```

    Testing baseline vector search performance without GSI optimization...
    
    [Baseline Search] Testing vector search performance
    [Baseline Search] Query: 'What was manchester city manager pep guardiola's reaction to the team's current form?'
    [Baseline Search] Vector search completed in 0.8305 seconds
    [Baseline Search] Found 3 documents
    [Baseline Search] Top result distance: 0.457932 (lower = more similar)
    [Baseline Search] Top result preview: 'Promised change, but Juventus are back in crisis'
    
    "We have entirely changed the way we think about...
    
    Baseline vector search time (without GSI): 0.8305 seconds
    


### Create BHIVE GSI Index

Now let's create a BHIVE GSI vector index to enable high-performance vector searches. The index creation is done programmatically through the vector store.


```python
# Create GSI Vector Index for high-performance searches
print("Creating BHIVE GSI vector index...")
try:
    vector_store.create_index(
        index_type=IndexType.BHIVE, # Use IndexType.COMPOSITE for Composite index
        index_description="IVF,SQ8"
    )
    print("GSI Vector index created successfully")
    
    # Wait for index to become available
    print("Waiting for index to become available...")
    time.sleep(5)
    
except Exception as e:
    if "already exists" in str(e).lower():
        print("GSI Vector index already exists, proceeding...")
    else:
        print(f"Error creating GSI index: {str(e)}")
```

    Creating BHIVE GSI vector index...
    GSI Vector index created successfully
    Waiting for index to become available...


### Alternative: Composite Index Configuration

If your use case requires complex filtering with scalar attributes, you can create a **Composite index** instead by changing the configuration above:

```python
# Alternative: Create a Composite index for filtered searches
vector_store.create_index(
    index_type=IndexType.COMPOSITE,  # Instead of IndexType.BHIVE
    index_description="IVF,SQ8"      # Same quantization settings
)
```

### Test 2: GSI-Optimized Performance

Test the same vector search with BHIVE GSI optimization.


```python
# Test vector search performance with GSI index
gsi_test_query = "What happened in the latest Premier League matches?"
print("Testing vector search performance with BHIVE GSI optimization...")
gsi_time = test_vector_search_performance(vector_store, gsi_test_query, "GSI-Optimized Search")
```

    Testing vector search performance with BHIVE GSI optimization...
    
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Testing vector search performance
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Query: 'What happened in the latest Premier League matches?'
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Vector search completed in 0.6452 seconds
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Found 3 documents
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Top result distance: 0.394714 (lower = more similar)
    [GSI-Optimized Search] Top result preview: The latest updates and analysis from the BBC.


### Test 3: Cache Benefits Testing

Now let's demonstrate how caching can improve performance for repeated queries. **Note**: Caching benefits apply to both baseline and GSI-optimized searches.


```python
# Set up Couchbase cache (can be applied to any search approach)
print("Setting up Couchbase cache for improved performance on repeated queries...")
cache = CouchbaseCache(
    cluster=cluster,
    bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
    scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
)
set_llm_cache(cache)
print("✓ Couchbase cache enabled!")
```

    Setting up Couchbase cache for improved performance on repeated queries...
    ✓ Couchbase cache enabled!



```python
# Test cache benefits with a different query to avoid interference
cache_test_query = "What are the latest football transfer developments?"

print("Testing cache benefits with vector search...")
print("First execution (cache miss):")
cache_time_1 = test_vector_search_performance(vector_store, cache_test_query, "Cache Test - First Run")

print("\nSecond execution (cache hit - should be faster):")
cache_time_2 = test_vector_search_performance(vector_store, cache_test_query, "Cache Test - Second Run")
```

    Testing cache benefits with vector search...
    First execution (cache miss):
    
    [Cache Test - First Run] Testing vector search performance
    [Cache Test - First Run] Query: 'What are the latest football transfer developments?'
    [Cache Test - First Run] Vector search completed in 0.9695 seconds
    [Cache Test - First Run] Found 3 documents
    [Cache Test - First Run] Top result distance: 0.394020 (lower = more similar)
    [Cache Test - First Run] Top result preview: The latest updates and analysis from the BBC.
    
    Second execution (cache hit - should be faster):

    [Cache Test - Second Run] Top result distance: 0.394020 (lower = more similar)
    [Cache Test - Second Run] Top result preview: The latest updates and analysis from the BBC.


### Vector Search Performance Analysis

Let's analyze the vector search performance improvements across all optimization levels:


```python
print("\n" + "="*80)
print("VECTOR SEARCH PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY")

## Jina AI RAG Demo

### What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

Now that we've optimized our vector search performance, let's demonstrate how to build a complete RAG system using Jina AI. RAG combines the power of our GSI-optimized semantic search with language model generation:

1. **Query Processing**: User question is converted to vector embedding using Jina AI
2. **Document Retrieval**: GSI BHIVE index finds most relevant documents (now with proven performance improvements)
3. **Context Assembly**: Retrieved documents provide factual context for the language model
4. **Response Generation**: Jina's language model generates intelligent answers grounded in the retrieved data

This demo shows how the vector search performance improvements we validated directly enhance the RAG workflow efficiency.

### Create Jina Language Model

Initialize Jina's chat model for generating intelligent responses based on our GSI-optimized retrieval system.


```python
print("Setting up Jina AI language model for RAG demo...")
try:
    llm = JinaChat(temperature=0.1, jinachat_api_key=JINACHAT_API_KEY)
    print("✓ JinaChat language model created successfully")
    logging.info("Successfully created JinaChat")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Error creating JinaChat: {str(e)}")
    print("Please check your JINACHAT_API_KEY and network connection.")
    raise
```

### Build Optimized RAG Pipeline

Create the complete RAG pipeline that integrates our GSI-optimized vector search with Jina's language model.


```python
try:
    # Create RAG prompt template for structured responses
    template = """You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. 
    If you cannot answer based on the context provided, respond with a generic answer. 
    Answer the question as truthfully as possible using the context below:
    
    Context:
    {context}

    Question: {question}
    
    Answer:"""
    
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

    # Build the RAG chain: GSI-Optimized Retrieval → Context → Generation → Output
    rag_chain = (
        {
            "context": vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 2}), 
            "question": RunnablePassthrough()
        }
        | prompt
        | llm
        | StrOutputParser()
    )
    print("Optimized RAG pipeline created successfully")
    print("Components: GSI BHIVE Vector Search → Context Assembly → Jina Language Model → Response")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating RAG pipeline: {str(e)}")
```
