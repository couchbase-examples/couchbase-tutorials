# Introduction

In this guide, we will walk you through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Couchbase Capella as the database, [gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) model as the large language model provided by OpenAI. We will use the [text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models) model for generating embeddings.

This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using:
- The [BBC News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime) containing news articles
- Couchbase Capella as the vector store with GSI (Global Secondary Index) for vector search
- LlamaIndex framework for the RAG pipeline
- OpenAI for embeddings and text generation

We leverage Couchbase's Global Secondary Index (GSI) vector search capabilities to create and manage vector indexes, enabling efficient semantic search capabilities. GSI provides high-performance vector search with support for both Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE) and Composite Vector Indexes, designed to scale to billions of vectors with low memory footprint and optimized concurrent operations.

Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional RAG system using OpenAI Services and LlamaIndex with Couchbase's advanced GSI vector search.

# Before you start

## Create and Deploy Your Operational cluster on Capella

To get started with Couchbase Capella, create an account and use it to deploy an operational cluster.

To know more, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html). 

### Couchbase Capella Configuration

When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:

* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.
* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.
* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.

### OpenAI Models Setup

In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. 

For this implementation, we'll use OpenAI's models which provide state-of-the-art performance for both embeddings and text generation:

**Embedding Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model, which provides high-quality embeddings with 3,072 dimensions for semantic search capabilities.

**Large Language Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model for generating responses based on the retrieved context. This model offers excellent reasoning capabilities and can handle complex queries effectively.

**Prerequisites for OpenAI Integration**:
* Create an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
* Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard
* Ensure you have sufficient credits or a valid payment method set up
* Set up your API key as an environment variable or input it securely in the notebook

For more details about OpenAI's models and pricing, please refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).


# Installing Necessary Libraries
To build our RAG system, we need a set of libraries. The libraries we install handle everything from connecting to databases to performing AI tasks. Each library has a specific role: Couchbase libraries manage database operations, LlamaIndex handles AI model integrations, and we will use the OpenAI SDK for generating embeddings and calling OpenAI's language models.



```python
# Install required packages
%pip install datasets llama-index-vector-stores-couchbase==0.6.0 llama-index-embeddings-openai==0.5.1 llama-index-llms-openai==0.5.6 llama-index==0.14.2
```

# Importing Necessary Libraries
The script starts by importing a series of libraries required for various tasks, including handling JSON, logging, time tracking, Couchbase connections, embedding generation, and dataset loading.



```python
import getpass
import base64
import logging
import sys
import time
from datetime import timedelta

from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.exceptions import CouchbaseException
from couchbase.options import ClusterOptions, KnownConfigProfiles, QueryOptions

from datasets import load_dataset

from llama_index.core import Settings, Document
from llama_index.core.ingestion import IngestionPipeline
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
from llama_index.vector_stores.couchbase import CouchbaseQueryVectorStore
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.vector_stores.couchbase import CouchbaseQueryVectorStore, QueryVectorSearchSimilarity, QueryVectorSearchType

```

# Loading Sensitive Information
In this section, we prompt the user to input essential configuration settings needed. These settings include sensitive information like database credentials, collection names, and API keys. Instead of hardcoding these details into the script, we request the user to provide them at runtime, ensuring flexibility and security.

The script also validates that all required inputs are provided, raising an error if any crucial information is missing. This approach ensures that your integration is both secure and correctly configured without hardcoding sensitive information, enhancing the overall security and maintainability of your code.

**OPENAI_API_KEY** is your OpenAI API key which can be obtained from your OpenAI dashboard at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

**INDEX_NAME** is the name of the GSI vector index we will create for vector search operations.


```python
CB_CONNECTION_STRING = input("Couchbase Cluster URL (default: localhost): ") or "localhost"
CB_USERNAME = input("Couchbase Username (default: admin): ") or "admin"
CB_PASSWORD = input("Couchbase password (default: Password@12345): ") or "Password@12345"
CB_BUCKET_NAME = input("Couchbase Bucket: ")
SCOPE_NAME = input("Couchbase Scope: ")
COLLECTION_NAME = input("Couchbase Collection: ")
INDEX_NAME = input("Vector Search Index: ")
OPENAI_API_KEY = input("OpenAI API Key: ")

# Check if the variables are correctly loaded
if not all([CB_CONNECTION_STRING, CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME, INDEX_NAME, OPENAI_API_KEY]):
    raise ValueError("All configuration variables must be provided.")

```

# Setting Up Logging
Logging is essential for tracking the execution of our script and debugging any issues that may arise. We set up a logger that will display information about the script's progress, including timestamps and log levels.



```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)],
)
```

# Connecting to Couchbase Capella
The next step is to establish a connection to our Couchbase Capella cluster. This connection will allow us to interact with the database, store and retrieve documents, and perform vector searches.



```python
try:
    # Initialize the Couchbase Cluster
    auth = PasswordAuthenticator(CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD)
    options = ClusterOptions(auth)
    options.apply_profile(KnownConfigProfiles.WanDevelopment)
    # Connect to the cluster
    cluster = Cluster(CB_CONNECTION_STRING, options)
    
    # Wait for the cluster to be ready
    cluster.wait_until_ready(timedelta(seconds=5))

    logging.info("Successfully connected to the Couchbase cluster")
except CouchbaseException as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to connect to Couchbase: {str(e)}")
```

# Setting Up the Bucket, Scope, and Collection
Before we can store our data, we need to ensure that the appropriate bucket, scope, and collection exist in our Couchbase cluster. The code below checks if these components exist and creates them if they don't, providing a foundation for storing our vector embeddings and documents.


```python
from couchbase.management.buckets import CreateBucketSettings
import json

# Create bucket if it does not exist
bucket_manager = cluster.buckets()
try:
    bucket_manager.get_bucket(CB_BUCKET_NAME)
    print(f"Bucket '{CB_BUCKET_NAME}' already exists.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Bucket '{CB_BUCKET_NAME}' does not exist. Creating bucket...")
    bucket_settings = CreateBucketSettings(name=CB_BUCKET_NAME, ram_quota_mb=500)
    bucket_manager.create_bucket(bucket_settings)
    print(f"Bucket '{CB_BUCKET_NAME}' created successfully.")

# Create scope and collection if they do not exist
collection_manager = cluster.bucket(CB_BUCKET_NAME).collections()
scopes = collection_manager.get_all_scopes()
scope_exists = any(scope.name == SCOPE_NAME for scope in scopes)

if scope_exists:
    print(f"Scope '{SCOPE_NAME}' already exists.")
else:
    print(f"Scope '{SCOPE_NAME}' does not exist. Creating scope...")
    collection_manager.create_scope(SCOPE_NAME)
    print(f"Scope '{SCOPE_NAME}' created successfully.")

collections = [collection.name for scope in scopes if scope.name == SCOPE_NAME for collection in scope.collections]
collection_exists = COLLECTION_NAME in collections

if collection_exists:
    print(f"Collection '{COLLECTION_NAME}' already exists in scope '{SCOPE_NAME}'.")
else:
    print(f"Collection '{COLLECTION_NAME}' does not exist in scope '{SCOPE_NAME}'. Creating collection...")
    collection_manager.create_collection(collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME, scope_name=SCOPE_NAME)
    print(f"Collection '{COLLECTION_NAME}' created successfully.")

scope = cluster.bucket(CB_BUCKET_NAME).scope(SCOPE_NAME)
```

# Setting Up GSI Vector Search
In this section, we'll set up the Couchbase vector store using GSI (Global Secondary Index) for high-performance vector search. Unlike FTS-based vector search, GSI vector search provides optimized performance for pure vector similarity operations and can scale to billions of vectors with low memory footprint.

GSI vector search supports two main index types:
- **Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE)**: Best for pure vector searches with high performance and concurrent operations
- **Composite Vector Indexes**: Best for filtered vector searches combining vector similarity with scalar filtering

For this tutorial, we'll use the Query vector store.


# Load the BBC News Dataset
To build a RAG engine, we need data to search through. We use the [BBC Realtime News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime), a dataset with up-to-date BBC news articles grouped by month. This dataset contains articles that were created after the LLM was trained. It will showcase the use of RAG to augment the LLM. 

The BBC News dataset's varied content allows us to simulate real-world scenarios where users ask complex questions, enabling us to fine-tune our RAG's ability to understand and respond to various types of queries.



```python
try:
    news_dataset = load_dataset('RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime', '2024-12', split="train")
    print(f"Loaded the BBC News dataset with {len(news_dataset)} rows")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error loading TREC dataset: {str(e)}")
```

## Preview the Data


```python
# Print the first two examples from the dataset
print("Dataset columns:", news_dataset.column_names)
print("\nFirst two examples:")
print(news_dataset[:2])
```

## Preparing the Data for RAG

We need to extract the context passages from the dataset to use as our knowledge base for the RAG system.


```python
import hashlib

news_articles = news_dataset
unique_articles = {}

for article in news_articles:
    content = article.get("content")
    if content:
        content_hash = hashlib.md5(content.encode()).hexdigest()  # Generate hash of content
        if content_hash not in unique_articles:
            unique_articles[content_hash] = article  # Store full article

unique_news_articles = list(unique_articles.values())  # Convert back to list

print(f"We have {len(unique_news_articles)} unique articles in our database.")

```

# Creating Embeddings using OpenAI
Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Unlike keyword-based search, embeddings enable semantic search to understand context and retrieve documents that are conceptually similar even without exact keyword matches. We'll use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model to create high-quality embeddings with 3,072 dimensions. This model transforms our text data into vector representations that can be efficiently searched, with a batch size of 30 for optimal processing.



```python
try:
    # Set up the embedding model
    embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(
        api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
        embed_batch_size=30,
        model="text-embedding-3-large"
    )
    
    # Configure LlamaIndex to use this embedding model
    Settings.embed_model = embed_model
    print("Successfully created embedding model")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating embedding model: {str(e)}")
```

# Testing the Embeddings Model
We can test the embeddings model by generating an embedding for a string


```python
test_embedding = embed_model.get_text_embedding("this is a test sentence")
print(f"Embedding dimension: {len(test_embedding)}")
```

# Setting Up the Couchbase GSI Vector Store
The GSI vector store is set up to store the documents from the dataset using Couchbase's Global Secondary Index vector search capabilities. This vector store is optimized for high-performance vector similarity search operations and can scale to billions of vectors.


```python
try:
    # Create the Couchbase GSI vector store
    vector_store = CouchbaseQueryVectorStore(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        search_type=QueryVectorSearchType.ANN,
        similarity=QueryVectorSearchSimilarity.DOT,
        nprobes=10
    )
    print("Successfully created GSI vector store")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create GSI vector store: {str(e)}")
```

# Creating LlamaIndex Documents
In this section, we'll process our news articles and create LlamaIndex Document objects.
Each Document is created with specific metadata and formatting templates to control what the LLM and embedding model see.
We'll observe examples of the formatted content to understand how the documents are structured.


```python
from llama_index.core.schema import MetadataMode

llama_documents = []
# Process and store documents
for article in unique_news_articles:  # Limit to first 100 for demo
    try:
        document = Document(
            text=article["content"],
            metadata={
                "title": article["title"],
                "description": article["description"],
                "published_date": article["published_date"],
                "link": article["link"],
            },
            excluded_llm_metadata_keys=["description"],
            excluded_embed_metadata_keys=["description", "published_date", "link"],
            metadata_template="{key}=>{value}",
            text_template="Metadata: \n{metadata_str}\n-----\nContent: {content}",
        )
        llama_documents.append(document)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to save document to vector store: {str(e)}")
        continue

# Observing an example of what the LLM and Embedding model receive as input
print("The LLM sees this:")
print(llama_documents[0].get_content(metadata_mode=MetadataMode.LLM))
print("The Embedding model sees this:")
print(llama_documents[0].get_content(metadata_mode=MetadataMode.EMBED))

        
```

# Creating and Running the Ingestion Pipeline

In this section, we'll create an ingestion pipeline to process our documents. The pipeline will:

1. Split the documents into smaller chunks (nodes) using the SentenceSplitter
2. Generate embeddings for each node using our embedding model
3. Store these nodes with their embeddings in our Couchbase vector store

This process transforms our raw documents into a searchable knowledge base that can be queried semantically.


```python


# Process documents: split into nodes, generate embeddings, and store in vector database
# Step 3: Create and Run IndexPipeline
index_pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
    transformations=[SentenceSplitter(),embed_model], 
    vector_store=vector_store,
)

index_pipeline.run(documents=llama_documents)

```

# Using OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM)
Large language models are AI systems that are trained to understand and generate human language. We'll be using OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model to process user queries and generate meaningful responses based on the retrieved context from our Couchbase vector store. This model is a key component of our RAG system, allowing it to go beyond simple keyword matching and truly understand the intent behind a query. By integrating OpenAI's LLM, we equip our RAG system with the ability to interpret complex queries, understand the nuances of language, and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

The language model's ability to understand context and generate coherent responses is what makes our RAG system truly intelligent. It can not only find the right information but also present it in a way that is useful and understandable to the user.

The LLM is configured using LlamaIndex's OpenAI-like provider with OpenAI's API endpoint and your OpenAI API key for seamless integration with their services.


```python
try:
    # Set up the LLM
    llm = OpenAI(
        api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
        model="gpt-4o",
        
    )
    # Configure LlamaIndex to use this LLM
    Settings.llm = llm
    logging.info("Successfully created the OpenAI LLM")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating OpenAI LLM: {str(e)}")
```

# Creating the Vector Store Index

In this section, we'll create a VectorStoreIndex from our Couchbase vector store. This index serves as the foundation for our RAG system, enabling semantic search capabilities and efficient retrieval of relevant information.

The VectorStoreIndex provides a high-level interface to interact with our vector store, allowing us to:
1. Perform semantic searches based on user queries
2. Retrieve the most relevant documents or chunks
3. Generate contextually appropriate responses using our LLM



```python
# Create your index
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)
rag = index.as_query_engine()
```

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and LlamaIndex

Let's test our RAG system by performing a semantic search on a sample query. In this example, we'll use a question about Pep Guardiola's reaction to Manchester City's recent form. The RAG system will:

1. Process the natural language query
2. Search through our vector database for relevant information
3. Retrieve the most semantically similar documents
4. Generate a comprehensive response using the LLM

This demonstrates how our system combines the power of vector search with language model capabilities to provide accurate, contextual answers based on the information in our database.

**Note:** By default, without any GSI vector index, Couchbase uses linear brute force search which compares the query vector against every document in the collection. This works for small datasets but can become slow as the dataset grows.


```python
# Sample query from the dataset

query = "Who will Daniel Dubois fight in Saudi Arabia on 22 February?"

try:
    # Perform the semantic search
    start_time = time.time()
    response = rag.query(query)
    search_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Display search results
    print(f"\nSemantic Search Results (completed in {search_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds):")
    print(response)

except RecursionError as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Error performing semantic search: {e}")
```

# Optimizing Vector Search with Global Secondary Index (GSI)

While the above RAG system works effectively, we can significantly improve query performance by leveraging Couchbase's advanced GSI vector search capabilities.

Couchbase offers three types of vector indexes, but for GSI-based vector search we focus on two main types:

**Hyperscale Vector Indexes**
- Best for pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search
- High performance with low memory footprint - designed to scale to billions of vectors
- Optimized for concurrent operations - supports simultaneous searches and inserts
- Use when: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering
- Ideal for: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery

**Composite Vector Indexes**
- Best for filtered vector searches - combines vector search with scalar value filtering
- Efficient pre-filtering - scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope
- Use when: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data
- Ideal for: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries

**Choosing the Right Index Type**
- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets
- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space
- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions

For more details, see the [Couchbase Vector Index documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html).

## Understanding Index Configuration (Couchbase 8.0 Feature)

The index_description parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage and search performance through centroids and quantization:

Format: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`

**Centroids (IVF - Inverted File):**
- Controls how the dataset is subdivided for faster searches
- More centroids = faster search, slower training  
- Fewer centroids = slower search, faster training
- If omitted (like IVF,SQ8), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size

**Quantization Options:**
- SQ (Scalar Quantization): SQ4, SQ6, SQ8 (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)
- PQ (Product Quantization): PQ<subquantizers>x<bits> (e.g., PQ32x8)
- Higher values = better accuracy, larger index size

**Common Examples:**
- IVF,SQ8 - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)
- IVF1000,SQ6 - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization  
- IVF,PQ32x8 - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits

For detailed configuration options, see the [Quantization & Centroid Settings](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/vector-index/hyperscale-vector-index.html#algo_settings).

In the code below, we demonstrate creating a BHIVE index for optimal performance. This method takes an index type (BHIVE or COMPOSITE) and description parameter for optimization settings. Alternatively, GSI indexes can be created manually from the Couchbase UI. 


```python
# Create a BHIVE (Hyperscale Vector Index) for optimized vector search
try:
    bhive_index_name = f"{INDEX_NAME}_bhive"

    options = {
        "dimension": 3072,
        "description": "IVF1024,PQ32x8",
        "similarity": "DOT",
    }
    scope.query(
        f"""
        CREATE INDEX {bhive_index_name}
        ON {COLLECTION_NAME} (embedding VECTOR)
        USING GSI WITH {json.dumps(options)}
        """,
    QueryOptions(
        timeout=timedelta(seconds=300)
    )).execute()
    print(f"Successfully created BHIVE index: {bhive_index_name}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"BHIVE index may already exist or error occurred: {str(e)}")

```

The example below shows running the same RAG query, but now using the BHIVE GSI index we created above. You'll notice improved performance as the index efficiently retrieves data.


```python
# Test the optimized GSI vector search with BHIVE index
query = "Who will Daniel Dubois fight in Saudi Arabia on 22 February?"
try:
    # Create a new query engine using the optimized vector store
    optimized_rag = index.as_query_engine()
    
    # Perform the semantic search with GSI optimization
    start_time = time.time()
    response = optimized_rag.query(query)
    search_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Display search results
    print(f"\nOptimized GSI Vector Search Results (completed in {search_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds):")
    print(response)

except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Error performing optimized semantic search: {e}")

```

# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Couchbase Capella's GSI vector search, OpenAI, and LlamaIndex. We used the BBC News dataset, which contains real-time news articles, to demonstrate how RAG can be used to answer questions about current events and provide up-to-date information that extends beyond the LLM's training data.

The key components of our RAG system include:

1. **Couchbase Capella GSI Vector Search** as the high-performance vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings
2. **LlamaIndex** as the framework for connecting our data to the LLM
3. **OpenAI Services** for generating embeddings (`text-embedding-3-large`) and LLM responses (`gpt-4o`)
4. **GSI Vector Indexes** (BHIVE/Composite) for optimized vector search performance

This approach allows us to enhance the capabilities of large language models by grounding their responses in specific, up-to-date information from our knowledge base, while leveraging Couchbase's advanced GSI vector search for optimal performance and scalability.
