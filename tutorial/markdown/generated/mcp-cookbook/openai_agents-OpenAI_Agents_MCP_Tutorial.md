# OpenAI Agents with Couchbase via Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A Tutorial

This notebook demonstrates how to build an intelligent agent using [OpenAI agents framework](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents) that can interact with a Couchbase database. The key to this interaction is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows the AI agent to seamlessly connect to and use Couchbase as a tool.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard designed to standardize how AI assistants and applications connect to and interact with external data sources, tools, and systems. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that allows AI models to seamlessly access the context they need to produce more relevant, accurate, and actionable responses.

**Key Goals and Features of MCP:**

*   **Standardized Communication:** MCP provides a common language and structure for AI models to communicate with diverse backend systems, replacing the need for numerous custom integrations.
*   **Enhanced Context Management:** It helps manage the limited context windows of LLMs efficiently, enabling them to maintain longer, more coherent interactions and leverage historical data.
*   **Secure Data Access:** MCP emphasizes secure connections, allowing developers to expose data through MCP servers while maintaining control over their infrastructure.
*   **Tool Use and Actionability:** It enables LLMs to not just retrieve information but also to use external tools and trigger actions in other systems.
*   **Interoperability:** Fosters an ecosystem where different AI tools, models, and data sources can work together more cohesively.

MCP aims to break down data silos, making it easier for AI to integrate with real-world applications and enterprise systems, leading to more powerful and context-aware AI solutions.

**MCP Typically Follows a Client-Server Architecture:**
*   **MCP Hosts/Clients:** Applications (like AI assistants, IDEs, or other AI-powered tools) that want to access data or capabilities. In this demo, this notebook, through the OpenAI agents framework, acts as an MCP client.
*   **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that expose specific data sources or tools (e.g., a database, an API) through the standardized MCP. The `couchbase-mcp-server` project fulfills this role for Couchbase.



# Before you start
## Get Credentials for OpenAI
Please follow the [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to generate the OpenAI credentials.
## Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on Capella

To get started with Couchbase Capella, create an account and use it to deploy a forever free tier operational cluster. This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn about Capella with no time constraint.

To learn more, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html).

### Couchbase Capella Configuration

When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met.

* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the required bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.
* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.
* Your Capella free-tier account includes a travel-sample bucket, with sample documents used for booking and travel purposes. You can find more information [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/run-first-queries.html).

## Setup Instructions

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following prerequisites met:

*   **Set Environment Variables:** This notebook loads the OpenAI API key and other environment variables from the `.env` file. Include the following:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    CB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_couchbase_connection_string
    CB_USERNAME=your_couchbase_username
    CB_PASSWORD=your_couchbase_password
    CB_BUCKET_NAME=your_target_bucket # e.g., travel-sample
    ```

    We have already included a `.env.sample` file. Change the file name to `.env` and fill in the environment variables.
*   **Setup uv:** uv is a modern and fast python package and project manager. We will use uv to run the MCP server. Install uv from [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installing-uv).
*   **Python Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries by running the code cell below.


```python
%pip install -q 'openai-agents==0.9.3' 'python-dotenv==1.2.1'
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.


## Importing Necessary Libraries

This cell imports the essential Python tools for our project:

*   **`dotenv`**: For loading secret API keys and other settings from a `.env` file.
*   **`agents` (`Agent`, `Runner`, `gen_trace_id`, `trace`)**: Custom modules related to the agent framework being used, providing core agent functionalities, a way to run agents, generate trace IDs for debugging/monitoring, and tracing capabilities.
*   **`agents.mcp` (`MCPServer`, `MCPServerStdio`)**: Custom modules for interacting with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), specifically for setting up an MCP server, possibly one that communicates over standard input/output (stdio).

Running this cell makes all these components ready to use.


```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents import Agent, Runner, gen_trace_id, trace
from agents.mcp import MCPServer, MCPServerStdio
import os

load_dotenv()
```




    True



## Defining the Question-Answering Function

This cell defines an asynchronous function `qna(agent)` that we'll use to interact with our agent.

*   It takes the created `agent` as an argument.
*   The function defines a series of example questions (as `message` strings) that are posed to the agent.
*   For each question, it calls `await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)` to get the agent's response. The `Runner.run` method is responsible for executing the agent with the given input.
*   The agent, in turn, queries the Couchbase MCP to retrieve travel-related data, formats it, and presents it as the final output, which is then printed.
*   This function allows us to easily test the agent with multiple queries in sequence and observe its responses.


```python
async def qna(agent):
    message = "Tell me about the database that you are connected to."
    print(f"\n\n**Running**: {message}\n")
    result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
    print(result.final_output)
    print('-'*50)

    message = "List out the top 5 hotels by the highest aggregate rating?"
    print(f"\n\n**Running**: {message}\n")
    result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
    print(result.final_output)
    print('-'*50)

    message = "Recommend me a flight and hotel from New York to San Francisco"
    print(f"\n\n**Running**: {message}\n")
    result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
    print(result.final_output)
    print('-'*50)

    message = "I'm going to the UK for 1 week. Recommend some great spots to visit for sightseeing. Also mention the respective prices of those places for adults and kids."
    print(f"\n\n**Running**: {message}\n")
    result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
    print(result.final_output)
    print('-'*50)

    message = "My budget is around 30 pounds a night. What will be the best hotel to stay in?"
    print(f"\n\n**Running**: {message}\n")
    result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=message)
    print(result.final_output)
    print('-'*50)
```

## Defining the System Prompt

The system prompt is a crucial piece of instruction given to the Large Language Model (LLM) that powers our agent. It sets the context, defines the agent's persona, capabilities, and constraints.

In this system prompt:
*   We explain the **Couchbase data hierarchy** (Cluster, Bucket, Scope, Collection, Document) to help the LLM understand how the data is organized.
*   We specifically instruct the agent that **"The data is inside `inventory` scope, so use only that scope."** This focuses the agent on the relevant part of the `travel-sample` database.
*   We provide **SQL++ query generation guidelines**:
    *   "Any query you generate needs to have only the collection name in the FROM clause."
    *   "Every field, collection, scope or bucket name inside the query should be inside backticks."
*   The overall goal is to guide the LLM to use the provided MCP tools (which will be Couchbase operations) effectively and to formulate correct SQL++ queries for the `inventory` scope.

A well-crafted system prompt significantly improves the agent's performance and reliability.



```python
system_prompt = """Couchbase organizes data with the following hierarchy (from top to bottom):
1. Cluster: The overall container of all Couchbase data and services.
2. Bucket: A bucket is similar to a database in traditional systems. Each bucket contains multiple scopes. Example: "users", "analytics", "products"
3. Scope: A scope is a namespace within a bucket that groups collections. Scopes help isolate data for different microservices or tenants. Default scope name: _default
4. Collection: The equivalent of a table in relational databases. Collections store JSON documents. Default collection name: _default
5. Document: The atomic data unit (usually JSON) stored in a collection. Each document has a unique key within its collection.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- ALWAYS use the tools to query the database to answer questions. NEVER answer from your own knowledge.
- If the database does not contain relevant data, say so explicitly rather than making up an answer.

IMPORTANT SQL++ Query Rules:
- Use the tools to read the database and answer questions based on this database
- The data is inside `inventory` scope, so use only that scope
- Use only the collection name in the FROM clause (e.g., FROM `hotel`)
- Collection names and top-level field names should be in backticks
- For nested fields, use dot notation WITHOUT backticks around each part
  CORRECT: `hotel`.reviews[0].ratings.Overall
  WRONG: `hotel`.`reviews`.`ratings`.`Overall`

- When accessing nested objects or arrays, use bracket notation or dot notation directly
Examples:
- hotel.reviews[0].author
- hotel.geo.lat

Available Collections in `inventory` scope:
- `airline`: Airline information (name, callsign, iata, icao, country, etc.)
- `airport`: Airport data (airportname, faa, city, country, geo, tz, etc.)
- `hotel`: Hotel/accommodation data (see structure below)
- `landmark`: Sightseeing spots, tourist attractions, restaurants, activities (see structure below)
- `route`: Flight route information (airline, sourceairport, destinationairport, distance, schedule, etc.)

Hotel Document Structure:
- Top-level fields: name, city, country, state, address, description, price, type, id, vacancy, pets_ok etc.
- address: A string field containing the street address (e.g., "321 Castro St")
- city, country, state: Top-level string fields (e.g., city = "San Francisco", country = "United States")
- geo: Object with fields {lat, lon, accuracy}
- reviews: Array of review objects with ratings and content
- To filter by city or country: WHERE `city` = "San Francisco" OR WHERE `country` = "United States"
- Do NOT use "addresses" (plural) - the field is "address" (singular)

Landmark Document Structure:
- Top-level fields: name, city, country, state, address, content, activity, price, phone, url, email, hours, directions, toll_free, image, geo, etc.
- activity: Type of landmark (e.g., "see", "do", "eat", "drink", "buy", "listing")
- content: Description of the landmark
- price: Price or admission information (may be a string or null)
- For sightseeing queries, use the `landmark` collection and filter by activity = "see" or "do"
- Example: SELECT `name`, `city`, `price`, `content`, `activity` FROM `landmark` WHERE `country` = "United Kingdom" AND `activity` = "see" 

Airline Document Structure:
- Top-level fields: name, callsign, iata, icao, country, type, id

Route Document Structure:
- Top-level fields: airline, airlineid, sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, equipment, schedule, distance, type, id
- schedule: Array of objects with {day, utc, flight}

ARRAY Operations in SQL++:
- To aggregate data from arrays (like reviews), use UNNEST to flatten the array first
- CORRECT way to sum array values:

  SELECT h.name, SUM(r.ratings.Overall) as total_rating
  FROM `hotel` h
  UNNEST h.reviews r
  GROUP BY h.name
  ORDER BY total_rating DESC

- WRONG ways (these will cause parser errors):
  x SELECT name, SUM(ARRAY_SUM(ARRAY reviews[*].ratings.Overall FOR reviews IN...))
  x SELECT name, ARRAY reviews[*].ratings.Overall FOR reviews...
  x WHERE ANY a IN addresses SATISFIES... (wrong field name)

- Use UNNEST whenever you need to work with individual array elements in aggregations"""
```

## Configuring the Agent and Language Model

This cell sets up the agent.

*   The code defines an asynchronous function `run` that initializes an AI agent.
*   This Assistant is configured with specific instructions (from `system_prompt`), uses the "gpt-5.2" model, and is connected to the Couchbase MCP server (`mcp_server`).
*   The function then calls `qna`, to start the question-and-answer process with the database.



```python
async def run(mcp_server: MCPServer):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions=system_prompt,
        model="gpt-5.2",
        mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
    )

    await qna(agent=agent)
```

## Initialize the MCP Server and Running The Agent

This cell:

*   **Starts Couchbase MCP Server:** Initializes the `couchbase-mcp-server` using `MCPServerStdio`.
*  **Uses Prebuilt Package:** The server runs the `couchbase-mcp-server` package from PyPI via `uvx couchbase-mcp-server`\n",
*   **Note:** The MCP server reads environment variables (DB credentials) from the `.env` file in the parent directory via `python-dotenv`, which was loaded in an earlier cell.
*   **Enables Agent-DB Communication:** The started `server` object is passed to the `run` function, allowing the AI agent to interact with Couchbase via MCP.
*   **Observability:** Sets up tracing to monitor agent interactions.

The agent will then attempt to answer the series of questions defined in the `qna` function by:
*   Reasoning about the question.
*   Deciding if a Couchbase tool is needed.
*   Formulating a SQL++ query (if appropriate, based on the system prompt).
*   Executing the tool (which sends the query to the MCP server, which then runs it on Couchbase).
*   Using the tool's output to generate a natural language response.


```python
async with MCPServerStdio(
    params={
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["couchbase-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
            "CB_CONNECTION_STRING": os.getenv("CB_CONNECTION_STRING"),
            "CB_USERNAME": os.getenv("CB_USERNAME"),
            "CB_PASSWORD": os.getenv("CB_PASSWORD"),
            "CB_BUCKET_NAME": os.getenv("CB_BUCKET_NAME")
        }
    }
) as server:
    trace_id = gen_trace_id()
    with trace(trace_id=trace_id, workflow_name="CouchbaseDemo"):
        print(f"View trace: https://platform.openai.com/traces/trace?trace_id={trace_id}\n")
        print("-"*25, "Starting Run", "-"*25)
        await run(server)
```

    ------------------------- Starting Run -------------------------
    
    
    **Running**: Tell me about the database that you are connected to.
    
    You’re connected to a local **Couchbase Server cluster** (connection string: `couchbase://localhost`) using the **Administrator** user. The environment is configured in **read-only mode** (no writes).
    
    ## What’s in this cluster
    ### Buckets
    - **`travel-sample`** (the only bucket present)
    
    ### Scopes & collections (in `travel-sample`)
    - **`inventory`** (this is the scope I will use for data queries)
      - `airline`
      - `airport`
      - `hotel`
      - `landmark`
      - `route`
    - Other scopes also exist (e.g., `tenant_agent_00` … `tenant_agent_04` with `users`/`bookings`), plus `_default` and `_system`.
    
    ## Inventory data size (document counts)
    Within scope **`inventory`**:
    - `airline`: **187**
    - `airport`: **1,968**
    - `hotel`: **917**
    - `landmark`: **4,495**
    - `route`: **24,024**
    
    ## Indexes (inventory scope)
    There are ready indexes including:
    - Primary indexes on: `airline`, `airport`, `hotel`, `landmark`, `route`
    - Secondary indexes such as:
      - `airport(airportname)`, `airport(city)`, `airport(faa)`
      - `hotel(city)`
      - `landmark(city)`
      - route-focused indexes (e.g., on `sourceairport`, and array/schedule-related fields)
    
    ## Cluster services & health
    Services reachable and reporting **ok**:
    - KV, Query, Analytics, Search, Views, Management  
    (latencies were a few milliseconds as reported by ping)
    
    If you tell me what kind of data you want to explore (hotels, airports, routes, etc.), I can summarize key fields or run specific queries in the `inventory` scope.
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    
    **Running**: List out the top 5 hotels by the highest aggregate rating?
    
    Top 5 hotels by highest **aggregate (sum) Overall rating** across all reviews:
    
    1. **Hotel Eldorado** — aggregate_rating: **109** (review_count: 29)  
    2. **Hafod Lon Holiday Apartment** — aggregate_rating: **70** (review_count: 17)  
    3. **Uist Outdoor Centre** — aggregate_rating: **53** (review_count: 12)  
    4. **Lochmaddy Hotel** — aggregate_rating: **50** (review_count: 11)  
    5. **Radisson Blu** — aggregate_rating: **50** (review_count: 13)
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    
    **Running**: Recommend me a flight and hotel from New York to San Francisco
    
    ### Flight (nonstop)
    **United Airlines (UA)** — **EWR → SFO** (Newark Liberty Intl → San Francisco Intl)  
    - Stops: **0 (nonstop)**  
    - Distance: **~4118 km**  
    - Aircraft/equipment listed: **739 / 319 / 738 / 752 / 73G** (varies by flight)
    
    (Alternative nonstop also shown in the data: **Virgin America (VX)** on **EWR → SFO**.)
    
    ### Hotel (San Francisco, available + strong reviews)
    **Wharf Inn** — **2601 Mason St, San Francisco, CA**  
    - Avg review rating: **5.0** (from **8** reviews)  
    - Price: **$160–$195**  
    - Notes: “Small, friendly, in the heart of Fisherman’s Wharf… free parking.”
    
    If you tell me your travel dates and your preference (cheapest vs best-rated vs specific neighborhood), I can narrow it down further.
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    
    **Running**: I'm going to the UK for 1 week. Recommend some great spots to visit for sightseeing. Also mention the respective prices of those places for adults and kids.
    
    Here are some **UK sightseeing (“see/do”) spots** from the database, with the **prices shown for adults and kids when explicitly provided**:
    
    | Place | Where (city) | What it is | Adult price | Kids price |
    |---|---|---|---:|---:|
    | **Saltram House** | (city not listed) | Historic Georgian house & estate | **£10.00** | **£5.00** |
    | **Thinktank** | (city not listed) | Science museum (hands-on exhibits; IMAX mentioned) | **£6.95** | **£4.95** |
    | **Richborough Roman Fort and Amphitheatre** | Ash | Roman fort & amphitheatre (English Heritage) | **£5.00** | **£3.00** |
    | **Castell-y-Bere** | (city not listed) | Ruined 13th-century Welsh castle in dramatic scenery | **Free entry** | **Free entry** |
    | **Menai Suspension Bridge** | Bangor | Iconic bridge (Thomas Telford, completed 1826) | **Free** | **Free** |
    
    Notes (based on what’s stored in the dataset):
    - Many UK landmarks have `price = null` or a single non-split value (e.g., “£11”, “From £39 per person”), so I **can’t reliably give adult vs. child prices** for those from this data.
    - If you tell me **which cities you’ll base yourself in** (e.g., London + Edinburgh), I can query a tighter list nearby and prioritize spots with clearly stated pricing.
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    
    **Running**: My budget is around 30 pounds a night. What will be the best hotel to stay in?
    
    Based on the hotels in our database with a nightly `price` **≤ 30** and **at least 3 reviews**, the best-rated option is:
    
    - **Stirling Youth Hostel** (Stirling, United Kingdom) — **£26/night**  
      - **Average review rating (Overall): 4.71/5**  
      - **Reviews counted: 7**
    
    If you want, tell me what **city/country** you’re traveling to and whether **hostels are OK**, and I can narrow it down to the best match for your trip.
    --------------------------------------------------
